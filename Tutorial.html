<h3>Hypothesen</h3>
<p>Folgende Hypothesen haben wir aufgestellt und wollen diese im Verlauf
dieses Tutorials Überprüfen:</p>
<ul>
<li>Die Wahrscheinlichkeit als Frau zu überleben ist höher, als als
Mann.</li>
<li>Die Wahrscheinlichkeit zu überleben steigt mit der Wertigkeit der
gebuchten Klasse.</li>
<li>Die Wahrscheinlichkeit zu überleben sinkt mit dem Anstieg des
Alters.</li>

<h2>Datenaufbereitung</h2>
<div id="section-einlesen-der-daten" class="section level3">
<h3>Einlesen der Daten</h3>
<p>Um die Daten aus einer Excel-Datei zu lesen, verwenden wir die
‘readxl’-Bibliothek.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>titanic &lt;- read_xlsx(&quot;Titanic.xlsx&quot;)</code></pre>
<p>Für eine CSV-Datei würde der Befehl so lauten:<br> <em>titanic &lt;-
read_csv(“Titanic.csv”)</em></p>
<p>Die Daten einer Erhebung werden in der Regel als
<strong>Rohdaten</strong> oder <strong>Urlisten</strong> bezeichnet und
wurden noch nicht bearbeitet.<br> Bei einer
<strong>Vollerehebung</strong> werden bei der Datenerhebung alle
statistischen Einheiten einer Grundgesamtheit erfasst. Da dies in den
meisten Fällen nicht möglich ist, erfolgt eine
<strong>Teilerhebung</strong> in Form einer
<strong>Stichprobe</strong>.<br> Dies ist auch hier der Fall
gewesen.</p>
</div>
<div id="section-inkonsistenzen-und-leerstellen-beheben"
class="section level3">
<h3>Inkonsistenzen und Leerstellen beheben</h3>
<p>Da Rohdaten häufig unvollständig, inkonsistent oder fehlerbehaftet
sind, muss im ersten Schritt eine <strong>Datenbereinigung</strong>
stattfinden. Hierbei werden die Daten vorverarbeitet und somit
verändert, aufgefüllt oder auch gelöscht. <br> Was in einem konkreten
Fall sinnvoll ist, hängt vom Datentyp, der Anwendung und Fragestellung
ab.<br> Bekannte Beispiele für Dateninkonsistenzen sind Datumsangaben
oder Länderbezeichnungen. Wo Datumsangaben bei unterschiedlichen
Formaten mit Tools wie Excel oder R automatisch angepasst werden können,
bedürfen Länderbezeichnungen oft manueller oder halbautomatische
Lösungen.</p>
<p>Eine besondere Aufmerksamkeit gilt auch dem Umgang mit fehlenden
Daten, die sowohl bei selbst erhobenen, als auch bei extern bezogenen
Datenquellen auftreten können.<br> Hierbei gibt es zwei gängige
Methoden, fehlende Daten zu handhaben:</p>
<div id="section-ausschluss-von-daten" class="section level4">
<h4>Ausschluss von Daten</h4>
<p>Die einfachste Möglichkeit im Umgang mit fehlenden Daten ist der
Ausschluss von Beobachtungen mit fehlenden Daten. Dabei muss zuerst
entschieden werden, welche Merkmale besonders wichtig für den Datensatz
sind und welche nach möglichkeit keine <strong>NULL-Werte</strong>
enthalten sollten.</p>
<p>Welche von den vorherigen genannten Merkmalen könnten in unserem
Datensatz besonders relevant sein (auch im Hinblick auf unsere
Hypothesen)?</p>
<div class="panel panel-default tutorial-question-container">
<div data-label="quiz1" class="tutorial-question panel-body">
<div id="quiz1-answer_container" class="shiny-html-output"></div>
<div id="quiz1-message_container" class="shiny-html-output"></div>
<div id="quiz1-action_button_container" class="shiny-html-output"></div>
<script>if (Tutorial.triggerMathJax) Tutorial.triggerMathJax()</script>
</div>
</div>
<p>Da wir nun alle wichtigen Merkmale identifiziert haben, können wir
uns darum kümmern, den Datensatz zu bereinigen. Hierfür bereinigen wir
erst alle Einträge, welche keine Angaben bei unseren wichtigen Mermalen
enthalten. Da der Datensatz von Natur aus keine NULL-Werte in den
Spalten “überlebt”, “Klasse” und “Geschlecht” enthält, müssen wir das
nur noch für das Mermal “Alter” tun.</p>
<p>Hierfür legen wir als erstes eine neue Tabelle mit dem Namen
“titanic_clean” an:<br></p>
<pre class="r"><code>titanic_clean &lt;- titanic</code></pre>
<p>Anschließend entfernen wir mit Hilfe einer Filter-Funktion alle
Zeilen mit NULL-Werten beim “Alter”:<br></p>
<pre class="r"><code>titanic_clean &lt;- titanic_clean %&gt;%
  filter(!is.na(age))

datatable(titanic_clean, options = list(pageLength = 5, scrollX = TRUE))</code></pre>

<p>Wie zu erkennen ist, hat die Tabelle nun einige Seiten weniger und es
sind keine NULL-Werte mehr beim “Alter” vorhanden. Als nächstes wollen
wir noch alle unrealistischen Einträge entfernen. Hierfür beschränken

<p>Die andere Methode ist es, fehlende Daten durch “sinnvolle” Daten zu
ersetzen. Hierbei werden am einfachsten Lagemaße wie Mittelwert, Median
oder Modus als “sinnvolle” Werte verwendet. Aufwendigere Verfahren
arbeiten mit speziellen Schätzern, die beispielsweise
Regressionsverfahren verwenden. <br> <br> Für eine Zusammenfassung, wie
die Datenaufbereitung in R funktioniert, kannst du dir dieses Video

<h2>Datenanalyse</h2>
<p>Da wir nun die Bereinigung erfolgreich durchgeführt haben, können wir
mit der Datenanalyse fortfahren. Im weitern Verlauf werden wir die
“titanic_clean”-Tabelle nutzen, da diese entsprechend der Aufgabe aus
dem letzten Kapitel bereinigt wurde.</p>
<div id="section-mittelwert" class="section level3">
<h3>Mittelwert</h3>
<p>Der <strong>Mittelwert</strong> dient, wie der Name bereits sagt der
Ermittlung des Durchschnittswerts eines Merkmals. Eine alternative
Bezeichnung wäre das arithmetisches Mittel. Um den Mittelwert zu
berechnen werden alle Daten einer Datenreihe addiert und anschließend
durch die Anzahl der Beobachtungswerte geteilt.<br> In R kann der
Mittelwert mit der “mean()”-Funktion berechnet werden. Dafür müssen aber
vorerst die Werte des entsprechenden Merkmals extrahiert werden. Wir
nehmen dafür wieder das “Alter”.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>alter &lt;- titanic_clean$age</code></pre>
<p>Anschließend können wir den Mittelwert berechnen.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>mean(alter)</code></pre>
<pre><code>## [1] 30.59724</code></pre>
</div>
<div id="section-median" class="section level3">
<h3>Median</h3>
<p>Der <strong>Median</strong> eines Datensatzes stellt den Wert dar,
welcher genau in der Mitte liegt. Bei einer nach Größe sortierten
Datenreihe wäre das der Wert, welcher sowohl links als auch rechts von
sich gleich viele Werte hat. Darum wird der Median auch als Zentralwert
bezeichnet.<br> Die Berechnung des Medians in R erfolgt über die
median()-Funktion.<br> Bitte lies wieder das “Alter” aus dem bereinigten
Datensatz aus und berechne den Median.</p>

<h3>Varianz</h3>
<p>Die <strong>Varianz</strong> beschreibt ein Maß, das die Streuung der
Werte eines Merkmals definiert - anders gesagt wie stark unterscheiden
sich die Werte.<br> Eine höhere Varianz bedeutet, dass die Werte eines
ausgesuchten Merkmals weiter auseinander liegen, während man aus einer
niedrigen Varianz folgern kann, dass die Werte näher am Mittelwert
liegen. Die Varianz ist allerdings nicht normiert weswegen es schwer zu
berurteilen ist, ob diese groß oder klein ist. Eine Möglichkeit dies
besser zu beurteilen ist die <strong>Standardabweichung</strong><br> Die
Berechnung der Varianz erfolgt über die
<strong>var(subset)-Funktion</strong>. Bitte ließ wieder das “Alter” aus
dem bereinigten Datensatz aus und berechne damit die Varianz.</p>

<h3>Standardabweichung</h3>
<p>Die <strong>Standardabweichung</strong> ist wie die Varianz ein Maß,
dass die Streuung der Werte eines Merkmals definiert. Dieses Maß
beschreibt in diesem Fall die durchschnittliche Streuung um den
Mittelwert. Dieses Maß lässt sich auf in R auf mehrere weißen
bestimmen.<br> Eine Möglichkeit ist die bestimmung mithilfe der Varianz.
Die Standardabweichung ist definiert als die Wurzel aus der Varianz. Die
zweite Möglichkeit ist die verwendung der

<h3>Lineare Regression</h3>
<p><strong>Lineare Regression</strong> wird verwendet, um eine Beziehung
zwischen einer <strong>abhängigen Variable (Kriterium)</strong> und
einer <strong>unabhängigen Variable (Prädiktoren)</strong>
vorherzusagen.<br> Ein Beispiel: Man könnte die Hypothese aufstellen,
das Kinder und junge Erwachsene weniger Zahlen als ältere Personen.<br>
Wir wollen also überprüfen, ob das Kriterium - der Ticket-Preis,
abhängig vom Alter - der Prädiktoren ist. Dafür können wir beide werte
ersteinmal in ein Diagramm eintragen.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>titanic_cleanTask &lt;- titanic %&gt;%
  filter(!is.na(age)) %&gt;%
  filter(age &lt; 101)

<p><img src="Tutorial_files/figure-html/diagrammForLR-1.png" width="624" /></p>
<p>FÜr die Überprüfung des Zusammenhangs können wir dann eine sogennante
<strong>Regressionsgerade</strong> benutzen. Da es sich hierbei um eine
lineare Regression handelt hat diese die form y = bx + c.<br> Dabei ist
y der Kriteriumswert also der, den wir später vohersagen wollen und x
der Prädiktorwert.<br> Für die Berechnung der Regressionsgeraden gibt es
jetzt wieder zwei Möglichkeiten.<br> Die einfache Variante ist die
Verwendung der in R eingebundenen <strong>lm(subset ~ subset)
Funktion</strong>.<br> Mithilfe der <strong>abline(data,
col=“gewünschteFarbe”)-Funktion</strong> kann diese dann ausgegeben
werden. Füge in das untere Diagramm eine solche Regressionsgerade
ein.</p>

<p>Mithilfe dieser Gerade kannst du überprüfen, ob deine Hypothese wahr
ist.<br> Für den zweiten Weg nutzen wir die Geradengleichung und
brechnen die b und c werte. Der Vorteil dieser Methode ist es, das du
auch ohne grafischen Plot deine Hypothese prüfen kannst. Denn ist der b
Wert in der Geradengleichung positiv steigt diese und deine Hypothese
wäre somit korrekt. Ist dieser negativ sinkt diese und deine Hypothese
wäre falsch.<br> Für die Berechnung brauchst du die
<strong>Mittelwerte</strong> die <strong>Standardabweichungen</strong>
und die <strong>Korrelation</strong> beider Merkmale.</p>
</div>
<div id="section-korrelation" class="section level3">
<h3>Korrelation</h3>
<p>Die <strong>Korrelation</strong> kann den zusammenhang zwischen zwei
Variablen bestimmen. Dabei lässt sich folgendes folgern:<br> Wenn der
Korrelationskoeffizient positiv ist, sind die beiden Variablen
voneinander abhängig. In unserem Beispiel wären das das Alter und der
Ticket-Preis. Die Korrelation kann jedoch keine Aussagen darüber treffen
welches Merkmal das andere beeinflusst. Es herrscht also nicht unbedingt
Kausalität.<br> Für lineare Beziehungen kann man den
“Pearson-Korrelationskoeffizient” bestimmen. Dieser liegt immer zwischen
-1 und +1.<br> Die Berechnung kann auch nur auf Merkmale angewendet
werden die Kardinal skaliert sind.<br> Allgemein wird für die
Korrelation die <strong>cor(y~x)-Funktion</strong> verwendet Um die
Methode anzugeben kann noch das Argument <strong>method=“…”</strong>
übergeben werden.<br> Bestimme hier den Korrelationskoeffizienten des
Ticket-Preises (fare) und des Alters (age).</p>

<h3>Lineare Regression Teil 2</h3>
<p>Kommen wir nun zurück zum Beispiel aus dem ersten Teil der linearen
Regression. Erzeugen wir zuerst wieder den Plot aus dem ersten
Beispiel.<br> Im Anschluss können wir dann beide Geraden
vergleichen.<br> Für eine bessere Übersicht ist der Scatterplot
ausgeschalten</p>
<pre class="r"><code>titanic_cleanTask &lt;- titanic %&gt;%

<p><img src="Tutorial_files/figure-html/diagrammForLRTwo-1.png" width="624" /></p>
<p>Jetzt stellen wir die Regressionsgeradengleichung auf.<br> Diese hat
die Form: <strong>b = Standardabweichung(y)/Standardabweichung(x) *
Korrelation</strong><br> <strong>c =
Standardabweichung(y)/Standardabweichung(x) * Korrelation *
Mittelwert(x) + Mittelwert(y)</strong><br> <strong>x</strong> ist in
unserem Fall das <strong>Alter</strong><br> <strong>y</strong> ist der
<strong>Ticket-Preis</strong></p>
<pre class="r"><code>titanic_cleanTask &lt;- titanic %&gt;%
  filter(!is.na(age)) %&gt;%
  filter(age &lt; 101)
alter &lt;- titanic_cleanTask$age
gezahlt &lt;- titanic_cleanTask$fare

b &lt;- (sd(alter)/sd(gezahlt))*cor(alter,gezahlt,method=&quot;pearson&quot;)
c &lt;- (sd(alter)/sd(gezahlt))*cor(alter,gezahlt,method=&quot;pearson&quot;)*mean(gezahlt)+mean(alter)

plot(gezahlt ~ alter,xlab=&quot;Alter der Person&quot;,ylab=&quot;Ticket Preis&quot;, main=&quot;Regressionsgerade&quot;,pch=20,type=&quot;n&quot;)
abline(a=c,b=b,col=&quot;red&quot;,lwd = 3)</code></pre>
<p><img src="Tutorial_files/figure-html/equation-1.png" width="624" />
Wie man sieht sind die beiden geraden identisch. Außerdem kann man
Folgern, das die Steigung sehr klein aber positiv ist, was bedeutet, das
das Alter eine sehr kleine Auswirkung auf den Ticketpreis hat.</p>
